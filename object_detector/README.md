## OBJECT DETECTOR
This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico as its heart. A LED, LCD display and an ultrasonic sensor(HC SR04) is used along with some connecting wires. 

The distance detected by the sensor is displayed on the LCD display.

The LED is HIGH when an object is detected at a distance less than the specified distance.
